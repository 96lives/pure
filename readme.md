## Overview

This is a personal customization of the [pure theme](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure).
The pure ZSH theme is awesome, mainly because its **asynchronous** feature.
The difference to the original theme includes:

- A personally opinionated color schemes
- More verbose git information (**_asynchronously_ rendered, very fast**),
  including more git status (stashed/added/deleted/modified/moved/untracked/etc.)
- Python virtualenv and CUDA information
- Always display username and hostname
- Displays whether it is on vim-keybinding mode
